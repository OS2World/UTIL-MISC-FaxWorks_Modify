FaxWorks Modify
==================

With this utility, you can change the behaviour of FaxWorks
(included in WARP). One of the annoying things about it is,
that this light version doesn't allow to be started in auto
receive mode (Command line switch -R doesn't work).
Now you can write a small script that starts FaxWorks and
enables auto receive later.

Just start fwmod.exe and have a look at the available options.

Usage   : fwmod.exe [Options]
Options :
 -0  AutoReceive Off
 -!  AutoReceive Now
 -1  AutoReceive One
 -a  AutoReceive All
 -sx Set secs to wait before MessagePosting
 -q  Quit FaxWorks

By specifying any of the above options, you can modify a running
FaxWorks process. With the option -sx (substitute any number for x)
you delay the modification. So FaxWorks has a chance to get
started and get its windows open (When started in script).

Suggested Installation :
  Copy fwmod.exe & FaxWorks.cmd to your FaxWorks directory
  Modify FaxWorks Programm Object to start FaxWorks.cmd
  Modify FaxWorks.cmd to special needs (-a/-1/... and -sx)


Any comments are appreciated
